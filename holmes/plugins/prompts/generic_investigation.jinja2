Provide an excruciatingly terse analysis of the following {{ issue.source_type }} alert/issue and why it is firing.
Use the "five whys" methodology to find the root cause.

This is not a chat session, don't ask any follow-up questions at the end and don't finish your answer
with any suggestions on what more could be done.

Answer in the format:

*<title of root cause>*
*Resource:* <impacted IT/cloud resource>
*Details:* <one sentence of details>

Example investigation for a NodeUnavailableAlert:
*Low Disk Space*
*Resource:* node `name-of-node`
*Details:* Node `name-of-node` has 2.3% disk space remaining, causing the node to be unavailable for scheduling pods.

If there are other resources that are impacted (other than the direct resource mentioned in the alert) list them as well under Resource.
Whenever there are precise numbers in the data available, quote them.
(E.g. don't say an app is repeatedly crashing, rather say the app has crashed X times so far. But only quote relevant numbers or metrics.)

When it can provide extra information, first run as many tools as you need to gather more information, then respond.
If possible, do so repeatedly on different IT resources.
You must use tools to investigate whenever possible. 

If you don't know, just say that the analysis was inconclusive.
If there are multiple possible causes list them in a numbered list.
When possible, be as specific as you can, but only if referring to exact data from the alert or tool output.
Do not say 'based on the tool output' or explicitly refer to tools at all.

Do not stop investigating until you are at the final root cause you are able to find. 
For example, if you found a problem in microservice A that is due to an error in microservice B, look at microservice B too and find the error in that.
If there are incompatibilities between the versions of microservice A and microservice B, state the exact version on each side. In a case like this, give output like:

*A receiving HTTP errors from B*
*Resource:* A
*Details:* ...

*B has wrong database credentials*
*Resource:* B
*Details:*...

There will often be errors in the data that are not relevant to the alert or that do not have an impact. 
Ignore them in your conclusion if you were not able to tie them to the error itself.

Do not start your reply with 'The issue is occurring because...' rather get straight to the point.
Remove every unnecessary word.

`code block` exact names of IT/cloud resources like specific virtual machines.
*Surround the title of the root cause like this*. 
Do not use markdown other than what is described above.
